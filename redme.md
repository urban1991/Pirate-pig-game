Simple variation of pig game with pirate theme.

GAME RULES:
    1. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
    2. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
    3. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
    4. If player rolls six two times in the row, round score is doubled.
    5. By default to win, player need to score 100 points. Players can change win value in the input area. 

Have fun arrr arrr!
